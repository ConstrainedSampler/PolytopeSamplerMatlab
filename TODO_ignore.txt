Higher Priority:
1. move acceptedStep into Sampler
(move more thing to Sampler?)
2. Only terminate in MixingTimeEstimator if we have enough accepted steps
3. understand why hypercube is so slow....
4. Test if the body is single point, if it is, do something else.
5. Test if we can sample an problem
6. Allow to set initial point
7. Test on linux machine
8. Test on mac machine
9. Add DiskStorage? (Check what function uses s.samples)

> We need store some chains for estimating ess
10. Update analytic_center comments and look at the code again

Lower Priority:
0. Ask ruoqi to fix rhat
1. Linear system are not accurate enough. (Ax neq b)
2. Have more test on non-zero f
3. Write Hamiltonian class in mex to make it faster for small problems
4. nChains = 'auto'
