function [rhat_val] = rhat(x)
%rhat_val = rhat(x)
%compute rhat of each parameter in the matrix x
%
%Input:
% x - a dim x N vector, where N is the length of the chain.
%
%Output:
% rhat - a dim x 1 vector where ess(i) is the effective sample size of x(i,:).

% TODO: this is not a correct algorithm. Fix it.
% Now the input is always
% cell of matrices dim x N. Each matrix is a chain.
% What is the correct formula in this case?
% Update the comment also. It is wrong now.
